HTML Client and Server that runs a Simplified version of HTTP/1.1.
Implemented both GET and PUT Commands using JAVA Socket programming.

GET: 
1. Connect to the Server via a TCP connection.
2. Submit a valid GET request to the server.
3. Read the server's response and display it.

PUT:
1. Connect to the Server via a TCP connection.

Multithreaded Server has an infinite loop to listen for connections. Server can
be shut down with an termination Signal.
Server closes all the sockets beforing termination.
